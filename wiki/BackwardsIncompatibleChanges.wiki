This page lists backwards-incompatible changes to Django MPTT since the 0.1 release.

==Changes made after Django MPTT 0.1==

===Revision 77: Model registration changed===
Registering a model for MPTT is now handled by calling `mptt.register` instead of `mptt.models.treeify`.

===Revision 41: Simplified the node movement API===
`TreeManager.move_node` is now the _only_ public means of moving a node using `TreeManager` - it can figure out what to do based on the node and target given. All other node movement methods which were previously documented as public have been renamed to begin with underscores, indicating that they are for internal use.

This also has the benefit of simplifying implementation somewhat, as the methods which actually do the moving can trust `move_node` to give them the correct types of nodes when it matters that a given node must be a root node or a child node.
