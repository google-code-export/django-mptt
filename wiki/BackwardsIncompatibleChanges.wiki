None known. If you find one, it's probably a bug - please report it!

== `0.3.0` - Backwards incompatible changes since 0.2 ==

=== order_insertion_by ===

*NOTE* This was undone in 0.3.1 - in 0.3.1 you can use either a tuple, a list or just a string.

The `order_insertion_by` argument to `mptt.register` must now be a list of field names.

Old format:
{{{
mptt.register(MyModel, order_insertion_by='name')
}}}

New format:
{{{
mptt.register(MyModel, order_insertion_by=['name'])
}}}
